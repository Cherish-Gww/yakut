**`u`** is a simple cross-platform command-line interface (CLI) tool for diagnostics and debugging of
[UAVCAN](https://uavcan.org) networks.
By virtue of being based on [PyUAVCAN](https://github.com/UAVCAN/pyuavcan),
`u` supports all UAVCAN transports (UDP, serial, CAN, ...)
and is compatible with all major features of the protocol.
It is designed to be usable with GNU/Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Read the docs by executing **`u --help`**.
